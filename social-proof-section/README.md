## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I learned a lot of things during this projet since it's a lot harder and time consuming compared to other components since this project is a section. And it's impossible to include all my learnings here. However, the most notable one was learning how to create a layout inside a layout with the use of CSS flexbox and Grid.

### Continued development

I will continue to familiarize myself with HTML and CSS sections and in the future multi-page projects.
